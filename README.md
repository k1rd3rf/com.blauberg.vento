# Blauberg Vento

Unofficial app for the Blauberg Vento Expert Fans. This app uses local LAN communication using MODBUS to talk to your Blauberg fans. A special thanks to github user michaelkrog for creating the module that saved me lots of time.

Getting started
You need to use the Blauberg Home app to create device passwords for your fans.
Then after installing this app you can set the device password during the adding of the device.
